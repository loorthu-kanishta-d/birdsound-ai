🧠 **Abstract:**
        Birds are an important ecological species which are important in maintaining biodiversity. As indicators of biodiversity, birds are always worthy of being surveyed for biodiversity conservation. It was verified that bird calls are relatively stable as they present observable acoustic features among bird species. Many kinds of research considered identifying bird species or individuals by analyzing their sounds manually, such as analyzing the waveform, spectrogram, Mel Spectrogram, using bird sound clips. The proposed system is valuable for automatically identifying a massive number of bird species based on acoustic features and avian biodiversity monitoring. An efficient deep learning method based on LSTM for identifying massive bird species based on their acoustic features. The proposed methods of automatic sound recognition consist of different stages, such as preprocessing of the input audio file using wavelet filter, segmentation of syllables, MFCCs used for feature extraction followed by LSTM classification of sounds and identification of birds. With modern machine learning, including deep learning, general purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data, with no manual recalibration, and no pertaining to the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment.
