🐦 AI Bird Sound Analysis System

        🎯 Project Overview
                This project is an AI-powered system designed to identify and analyze bird species based on their vocalizations. It uses deep learning and audio signal                   processing to classify bird calls with high accuracy, supporting biodiversity monitoring and ecological research.
                
        🧠 Key Features
                🎵 Audio Input: Accepts bird sound recordings in .wav or .mp3 format
                📊 Spectrogram Conversion: Transforms audio into visual spectrograms for analysis
                🧬 Feature Extraction: Uses models like OpenL3, YAMNet, or CNNs to extract audio features
                🐤 Species Classification: Predicts bird species from sound using trained neural networks
                🌐 Web Interface (optional): Interactive dashboard for uploading and analyzing bird calls

        🛠️ Installation
                git clone https://github.com/loorthu-kanishta-d/birdsound-ai.git
                cd birdsound
                pip install -r requirements.txt
            Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and pip installed.

        🚀 Usage
                python main.py
                    You can upload .wav files via the UI or test the included files (aa.wav, bb.wav, etc.) using the script directly.    
                    
        📈 Results
                Trained on a dataset of 114 bird species from Xeno-canto
                Achieved 90%+ accuracy on validation set
                Robust against background noise and varied recording conditions
